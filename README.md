## Required Packages

You will need the dplyr package in order to run run_analysis.R

## Processing the data

### Data source

This processing code will work as long as you have either a subirectory of the 
current directory named "UCI HAR Dataset" with the data files in the 
unmodified sub-directories or you have a file in the current directory named
"getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip"

In the later case the file will be unzipped by the processing code.

### Processing

#### Column Naming

We used the feature names in features.txt to label the columns in the dataset.

This lets us use regex matching to find the columns representing the values 
generated by calls to mean() and std().  

#### Merging

To merge the test and training data sets we were able to simply use rbind(), 
since there was no overlap in the subject ids.

We merged each component of the training test data separately.  That is, we merged 
the feature information to a merged feature DF, merged the activity information
in y_train and x_train into a single activity vector, and similarly for the 
subject information.

We then turned the activity vector into a factor, using the labels in 
activity_labels.txt.

Instead of doing a cbind to add subject and activity columns to the feature
data frame we used aggregate.  This automatically added the subject and activity 
information in the process of aggregating the features by thode values.
